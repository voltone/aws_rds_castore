AWS RDS CA certificate store for Elixir and Erlang. See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html

Based on and derived from https://hex.pm/packages/castore

## Installation

### Elixir (Mix)

In your `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:aws_rds_castore, "~> 1.1"}
  ]
end
```

Then, run `$ mix deps.get`.

### Erlang (Rebar3)

In your `rebar.config`:

```erlang
{deps, [
  {aws_rds_castore, "~> 1.1"}
]}.
```

Then, run `$ rebar3 get-deps`.

## Usage

### Elixir (with Ecto)

```elixir
# In runtime.exs:
config :my_app, MyApp.Repo,
  url: database_url,
  ssl: true,
  ssl_opts: AwsRdsCAStore.ssl_opts(database_url),
  pool_size: String.to_integer(System.get_env("POOL_SIZE") || "10"),
  socket_options: maybe_ipv6
```

See [the documentation](https://hexdocs.pm/aws_rds_castore).

### Erlang (with PGo)

```erlang
PoolConfig = #{pool_size => 10,
               host => Host,
               database => "test",
               user => "test",
               ssl => true,
               ssl_options => aws_rds_castore:ssl_opts(Host)},
pgo:start_pool(default, PoolConfig).
```

## Updates

Every time there is an update to the AWS RDS CA certificate store, we'll release a new **patch version** of the library. For example, `1.1.12` â†’ `1.1.13`.

## Contributing

If you want to locally update the CA certificate store file bundled with this library, run the `mix aws_rds_ca_store.certdata` from the root of this library.
